- (you become a op, when you leave you are no longer an op)
    - when user creates a room 
        - check if they are in a room, if they are leave the room and enter the new one


- when you ceate a room you should enter that room

- settings implement chat op, topic, bann 

- (* later) show users that are online in chat
